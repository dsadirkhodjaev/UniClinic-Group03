Our team selected SDG 4 (Quality Education) because in our first semester for OOP subject my group already developed a Java program linked to SDG 13 (Climate Action),
and also touched SDG 6 (Clean Water) by calculating electricity use and water waste. From the remaining SDGs, SDG 4 felt most compelling, because we have heard many students
complaints about education issues, especially online learning. For example learning Bahasa Melayu online is hard because language learning needs interaction, some people think that 
staring at a screen reduces engagement. Online classes also make it harder for teacher to track each student, and some students also may feel uncomfortable or shy speaking to a screen, which
hurts participation.
