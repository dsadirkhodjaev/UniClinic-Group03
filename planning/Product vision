Our team selected SDG 3 (Good Health & Well-Being) because in our first semester for OOP subject my group already developed a Java program linked to SDG 13 (Climate Action),
and also touched SDG 6 (Clean Water) by calculating electricity use and water waste. From the remaining SDGs, SDG 3 (Good Health & Well-Being) felt most compelling, because we have heard many students
have academic pressure. Students face midterms, quizzes, assignments, so stress build up over the whole semester, not only during final weeks. GPA affects 
scholarships, internships, exchange programs, and sometimes family expectations, so even small grade drops can influent the student's mental health. All these stresses can show up
as poor sleep or even insomnia, headaches, stomach discomfort, low focus or anxiety which hurts both health and learning. We think that when students are stressed, they may avoid 
seeking support because they’re busy, unsure where to go, worried about being judged, or think the clinic is “too troublesome” to access. Thats why in our app we want to make it as much
friendly and efficient as could, so students can get support quickly and maintain good health and well-being.
